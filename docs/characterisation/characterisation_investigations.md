# Investigations into Characterisation of Data sets

## Overview

The initial part of the investigation into characterisation of datasets involved looking at the problems captured by the ESMValTool. The idea of this being that we could capture all the characterisitcs in datasets in CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX that are responsible for causing errors. The final aim of the investigation was to have a list of all characteristics that should be stored in our characterisation store.

These characteristics were found by recording the problem, the fix and then which part of the dataset the problem corrsponded to e.g. coordinate, global attribute, variable attribute or the data

## Scope of investigation

This particular investigation focused only on the problematic characteristics that had been captured by the ESMValTool and so was limited to CMIP5 and CMIP6 datasets.

## Results

The results from this investigation showed that none of the recorded problems were in relation to the global attributes.
